# ZOCEAN

## Description

Zocean is a VIM port of the Oceanic Next theme, inspired by the updates in the Visual Studio Code [Bimbo theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pawelgrzybek.bimbo-theme).

It supports [LightLine](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim).

In addition to the original [Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme), I've incorporated colors from:

- [Charcoal Oceanic Next](https://github.com/joshpeng/Charcoal-Oceanic-Next)
- [Charcoal Color Scheme](https://github.com/Dnld/charcoal-color-scheme)
- [Eagle Oceanic Next](https://github.com/Graf009/vscode-theme-eagle)

I also heavily leveraged the build out from arcticicestudios' Nord Vim theme, which is located [here](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim).
